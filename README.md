# OpenCv-Image-Processing

In this repository I explore various image processing and image analysis techiniques using OpenCV. I will begin with how to load and the various ways of processing the image to make the needed features more enhanced and later extract 
inforamtion from it through image analysis.


    Image loading and data extraction
    Image pixel access and point operations
    Neighbourhood operations
    Geometric operations
    Contrast enhancement
    Global and Local Histogram Equalization, and Histogram plotting
    Morphologiical Operations
    Image Smoothing
    Image Sharpening
    Edge Detection 
    Colour Based Segmentation
    Colour Style Transfer
    Harris Corner Detector
    Feature Detection and Matching
    Image Stitching
    Face detection
